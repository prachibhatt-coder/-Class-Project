            Facts About Among Us Game
          </H1>
          <p>Among Us takes place in space-themed settings where players are colorful, armless cartoon astronauts. Each player takes
        on one of two roles: most are Crewmates, but a small number are Impostors. Crewmates work to complete assigned tasks in
        the game while identifying and voting out suspected Impostors (who appear identical to Crewmates) using social
        deduction, while Impostors have the objective of killing the Crewmates. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia
        and the science fiction horror film The Thing.</p>
